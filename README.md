# Bakery-Inventory-Management
*About the Project: 
Our website is basically an inventory management system made for a single bakery store. We have included a list of all the items available and made the sales and purchase list available. To fill in these, the forms are made where one can enter the data they want to buy.
*Contributions: 
All three of us divided the work amongst us, the layout was decided by all of us and then we distributed the work as shown:
Ananya: Retrieval of data from the database and displaying in the website through nodejs and express. 
Avani: Pushing the data from the forms into the database in mongodb through nodejs and express.
Ishita: Designing of the website, layout, basically frontend portion.
*What did you learn: 
We learnt a good portion in backend including storing data in databases using mongodb, nodejs and express. We also learnt the use of ejs template and the working of css with it. We are also the retrieval of data from the database.
